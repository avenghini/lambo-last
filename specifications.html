    <h2 id="aventador">Aventador</h2>
    <p><b>Engine</b><br><br> The Aventador LP 700–4 uses Lamborghini's new 700 PS (515 kW; 690 bhp) 6,498 cc (6.5 L; 396.5 cu in) 60° V12 engine weighing 235 kg. Known internally as the L539, the new engine is Lamborghini's fifth in-house engine and
        second V12 design. It is the first all-new V12 since the 3.5 litre powerplant found in the 350GT.<br><br>
        <b>Performance</b><br><br> 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph): 2.9 s 0–161 km/h (0–100 mph): 6.4 s 400 m (1⁄4 mi): 10.6 s @ 220 km/h (137 mph)<br><br>
        <b>Top speed</b><br><br> Official: 350 km/h (217 mph) Measured by Sport Auto magazine: 370 km/h (230 mph) 97–0 km/h (60–0 mph): 30 m (100 ft)[citation needed] Cornering - 1.05g.[citation needed] The transmission, a single-clutch seven-speed semi-automatic,
        is built by Graziano Trasmissioni.[23][24] Despite being single-clutch, gear-shifts are accomplished in 50 milliseconds. The new, electronically controlled, all-wheel drive system is developed and supplied by the Swedish company Haldex Traction,
        offering traction[25] and handling capabilities based on their 4th generation technology.[26] The Lamborghini Aventador was replaced by the face-lifted Aventador S in 2016.</p>

    <h2 id="huracan">Huracan</h2>
    <p><b>Engine</b><br><br> The Huracán maintains the 5.2 L naturally aspirated Audi/Lamborghini V10 engine from the Gallardo, tuned to generate a maximum power output of 610 PS (449 kW; 602 hp). To ensure its balance and performance, the car is mid-engined. The engine has both direct fuel injection and multi-point fuel injection. It combines the benefits of both of these systems; it is the first time this combination is used in a V10 engine. To increase its efficiency, the Huracán's engine also includes a start-stop system.<br><br><b>Permormance</b><br><br> With a curb weight of 1,553 kg (3,424 lb), the Huracán LP610-4 has a power-to-weight ratio of 2.55 kg (5.62 lb) per horsepower. Road test acceleration of LP 610-4 (measurements by car magazines) 0–97 km/h (60 mph): 2.5 s 0–300 km/h (186 mph): 27.6 s 0–​1⁄4 mile: 10.4 s @ 217 km/h (135 mph) 0–1 km (0.62 mi): 19.1 s @ 272.20 km/h (169 mph) Maximum speed: 341 km/h (212 mph)<br><br><b>Electronic</b><br><br> The Huracán has electronically controlled all-wheel drive, which aims to increase the traction on various surfaces and the overall performance of the car. The car has a 7-speed dual clutch transmission, Lamborghini's new 'Doppia Frizione' (Dual Clutch) gearbox. The transmission performs differently depending on the mode the driver has selected.[49] The Huracán will only be available with an automatic transmission; a manual will not be offered.[50] The Huracán also has a magnetically controlled suspension system. It utilises magnetorheological dampers to very quickly change how the suspension acts, ensuring performance as well as usability. The Huracan has various components in common with the next generation Audi R8. This is due to both of the cars' utilization of Volkswagen Group sportscar technology.</p>

    <h2 id="urus">Urus</h2>
    <p>The Lamborghini Urus is much lighter than most of its competitors (i.e the Bentley Bentayga, Porsche Cayenne and Rolls-Royce Cullinan) at less than 2,200 kg (4,850 lb) as quoted by the manufacturer mainly because of the extensive usage of carbon fibre reinforced polymer, although it is based on the same platform as the Audi Q7, Bentley Bentayga, Porsche Cayenne, and Volkswagen Touareg. The engine is rated at a maximum power output of 478 kW (641 hp; 650 PS) at 6,000 rpm and maximum torque of 850 N⋅m (627 lb⋅ft) at 2,250–4,500 rpm. The Urus has a front-engine, all-wheel-drive layout, and a top speed of 305 km/h (190 mph) making it one of the world's fastest production SUVs. The Urus can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.6 seconds and 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 12.8 seconds. Lamborghini has developed the world's largest set of carbon ceramic brakes[citation needed] for the Urus, with 440 mm (17.32 in) rotors in the front and 370 mm (14.57 in) rotors in the rear using ten-piston callipers at the front and six-piston callipers at the rear. The all-wheel drive system of the Urus under normal driving sends 40 percent of the engine's torque to the front wheels and 60 percent to the rear wheels uses torque vectoring to send as much as 70 percent to the front or 87 percent to the rear when necessary. The SUV also features rear-wheel steering and an air suspension system that can provide a maximum of 250 mm (9.8 in) of ground clearance for off-road use. The SUV will be available with an optional off-road package, which includes modified front and rear bumpers that are better suited to the task. The Urus, like all of Lamborghini's current offerings, will feature a selection of driving modes, which adapt the suspension to improve the car's performance in various driving conditions. The Lamborghini Urus will feature Strada (street), Sport, Corsa (track), Terra (dirt), Sabbia (sand), and Neve (snow) driving modes, with the latter three possibly only available on the off-road package offered. The Urus has a base price of US$200,000 and will have a seating capacity of four to five people. </p>
